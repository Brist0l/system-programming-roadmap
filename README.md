# System Programming Roadmap

A three year old roadmap to teach myself compiler dev, malware reverse engineering and kernel dev fundamentals. To be noted they are only for the fundamental knowledge and doesn't make you a master of any. I will pick one or more of the above mentioned fields for later research in some specific topics.

## Prerequisites

I'm already assuming that you have basic understanding of computer architecture and experience with atleast one system programming language, some basics of how assembly works and familiar using unix.

### Learn some x86
If you are not familiar with assembly yet, I would recommend to check out some tutorials like-
- [Introduction to x86 assembly language by Davy on youtube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLmxT2pVYo5LB5EzTPZGfFN0c2GDiSXgQe)
- After being comfortable with the concepts, [x86 instruction listings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86_instruction_listings) on wikipedia will always be the goto guide for reference.
- And making C programs and reading the disassembly always helps to match patterns.
- [Article by 0x41 reversing for dummies](https://0x41.cf/reversing/2021/07/21/reversing-x86-and-c-code-for-beginners.html) to be able to reverse basic crackmes.

After this I would recommend to solve easy crackmes for exercise. [crackmes.one](https://crackmes.one) and tryhackme is a good place to find some of the easy ones. Hard ones still require some pwning knowledge which I'm gona discuss in the exploitation section.
