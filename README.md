# System Programming Roadmap

A three year old roadmap to teach myself compiler dev, malware reverse engineering and kernel dev fundamentals. To be noted they are only for the fundamental knowledge and doesn't make you a master of any. I will pick one or more of the above mentioned fields for later research in some specific topics.

## Prerequisites

I'm already assuming that you have basic understanding of computer architecture and experience with atleast one system programming language, some basics of how assembly works and already familiar using unix.
